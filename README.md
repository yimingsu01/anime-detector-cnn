# anime-detector-cnn
Anime Character Recognition by CNN and OpenCV.

# Kernel
`fate_kernel.py` contains the model and the training script. 

# Acknowledgement
Thanks to [@nagadomi](https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface) that this author provides an OpenCV cascade file `lbpcascade_animeface.xml` so that it's possible to extract anime character faces from frames. I only incoporated the author's cascade file and detector script `anime_detector.py` to my CNN model.
